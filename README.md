# routing_docker
docker version of EIDA Routing Service

Accordly with Routing-WS Documentation (https://github.com/EIDA/routing), 
fill and set the values of datacenter in the files inside the directory routingconf;
after that run the ./setup.sh script and wait a little.

After all the process is complete you can go on the server and put the address in the browser:
my.routing.server/eidaws/routing/1/version 
to check if it's working.
